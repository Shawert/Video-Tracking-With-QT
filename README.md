# Video-Tracking-With-QT
In my current project, I'm utilizing QT Creator to develop an application focused on tracking moving objects in videos, with OpenCV serving as the key library for achieving this objective. 
Currently, I'm engaged in evaluating the accuracy and performance of various tracking algorithms using a test video. Looking ahead, I intend to enhance the project by incorporating real-time image processing, 
enabling the tracking of objects in live camera feeds. This expansion aims to facilitate real-world applications and practical usage. 
The project entails a synergy between the robust algorithms of OpenCV and the user-friendly interface creation capabilities of QT Creator, culminating in the development of a visual object tracking application. 
Ultimately, my aim is to professionally complete the project, delivering a high-quality solution that aligns with user expectations.
